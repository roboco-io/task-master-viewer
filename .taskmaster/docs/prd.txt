PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)
Task Master Viewer - VS Code Extension
Version 1.0
Date: January 2025

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Task Master Viewer is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides a graphical user interface for viewing and managing Task Master tasks within the VS Code environment. The extension integrates seamlessly with existing Task Master workflows, allowing developers to visualize task status, update progress, and manage project tasks without leaving their development environment.

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Currently, Task Master users must interact with tasks through command-line interfaces or AI chat interactions, which can interrupt the development flow. There is no visual representation of task hierarchies, dependencies, or real-time status updates within the IDE where developers spend most of their time.

3. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
- Provide a native VS Code interface for Task Master task management
- Enable real-time visualization of task status and progress
- Allow quick task status updates without context switching
- Support automatic synchronization with Task Master file changes
- Maintain compatibility with existing Task Master file formats

4. TARGET USERS
- Software developers using Task Master for project management
- Teams collaborating on projects with Task Master integration
- Individual developers managing personal projects with Task Master

5. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

5.1 Task Display
- Display all tasks from .taskmaster directory in a tree view
- Show task title, status, and priority
- Use visual indicators (icons) for different task states
- Support both JSON and Markdown task file formats
- Auto-refresh when task files are modified

5.2 Task Management
- Update task status through context menu
- Support status transitions: pending → in-progress → completed
- Handle blocked status for tasks with dependencies
- Preserve all task metadata when updating status

5.3 User Interface
- Tree view in VS Code Explorer sidebar
- Collapsible task groups (future enhancement)
- Status-based color coding and icons
- Priority-based sorting (critical, high, medium, low)
- Refresh command in toolbar

5.4 File Monitoring
- Watch .taskmaster directory for changes
- Auto-reload tasks on file creation/modification/deletion
- Handle file parsing errors gracefully
- Support nested directory structures

6. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

6.1 Platform Support
- VS Code version 1.74.0 or higher
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- TypeScript-based implementation

6.2 Performance
- Load tasks asynchronously
- Minimal impact on VS Code startup time
- Efficient file watching with debouncing
- Handle large number of tasks (100+)

6.3 Data Formats
- JSON task format with full property support
- Markdown task format with metadata parsing
- Backward compatibility with Task Master formats
- UTF-8 encoding support

7. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

7.1 Usability
- Intuitive tree view navigation
- Clear visual status indicators
- Minimal learning curve for Task Master users
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

7.2 Reliability
- Graceful error handling
- No data loss during status updates
- Automatic recovery from file system errors
- Consistent state synchronization

7.3 Maintainability
- Clean, documented TypeScript code
- Modular architecture
- Comprehensive error logging
- Unit test coverage

8. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
- Task creation and deletion
- Drag-and-drop task reordering
- Task dependency visualization
- Integration with Task Master CLI
- Multi-workspace support
- Custom task filters and views
- Task templates
- Export task reports
- Integration with VS Code tasks

9. SUCCESS METRICS
- Successful loading of all task formats
- <100ms refresh time for typical projects
- Zero data loss during updates
- 95% user success rate for status updates
- Active usage by Task Master community

10. CONSTRAINTS AND ASSUMPTIONS
- Assumes .taskmaster directory in workspace root
- Limited to single workspace folder initially
- Requires manual refresh for external changes
- No direct Task Master API integration
- Read/write access to task files required

11. DEPENDENCIES
- VS Code Extension API
- Node.js file system APIs
- Task Master file format specifications
- VS Code theme color system

12. RELEASE PLAN
